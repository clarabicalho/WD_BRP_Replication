\begin{flushleft}\textit{Note:} We display difference-in-means estimates between material cost (T2) and the control condition in the vignette experiment. Country rows refer to average treatment effects of country samples. The pooled results report a difference in means with weights adjusted such that countries are weighted equally (rather than individuals being weighted equally). This avoids that results are driven primarily by Nigerian respondents, which comprise a majority (56 percent) of our sample. Column (1) outcome refers to the scaled answer to the vignette experiment for respondent beliefs about how likely the hypothetical individual is to accept a dinner invitation from a friend (1-very unlikely, 5 - very likely). Column (2) outcome is whether the respondent wrote a message encouraging others to practice physical distancing.  Column (3) outcome refers to whether the content of the message written appealed to coordinated collective effort (e.g., included terms such as `collaboration`, `together`, `union`). $^{*}$ $p<0.05$; $^{**}$ $p<0.01$; $^{***}$ $p<0.001$  \end{flushleft}
