\multicolumn{9}{l}{\scriptsize{Coefficients report differences between 'likely non-distancers' and 'likely distancers'. Columns 1-4 outcome refers to the expected behavior of a fellow countryman or woman (higher values indicate more likely to not physical distance) in the vignette experiment (column 1). Columns 5-8 outcome is the perception of other respondents' support for lockdown policy (column 2). In both columns, 'likely non-distancers' are coded as respondents who reported engaging in all activity listed in the list experiment in the condition that included an item for 'came within two meters of someone outside their household' (coded as 1), and those who reported having engaged in none of the activities ('Likely Non-Distancer' coded as 0). The regressions use robust standard errors. Pooled results include country-fixed effects. $^{***}p<0.001$; $^{**}p<0.01$; $^{*}p<0.05$}}
